  <p>So i am going to be writing about how to care for your pets and also what u need to do when u see a dog on a street and its looking at you.So first things first i am going to write about how to care for ur dog.U must clean it and feed it and groom it and so on.So when u see a dog on a road or a street or wherever u are u dont runaway from it u actually do nothing so in return for the dog he will do nothing to hurt you.when u do see a homeless dog u dont hurt it or throw stones on it because that will be hurting the dog nd dogs also got feelings.They can feel pain too and when u like play loud music or throw fire crackers by them they will get hurt bad and they might go deaf so u dont want to hurt these animals because they the way they are.If u dont like them its fine u dont have to show them that u dont like them and instead of hurting them u can just walk away.It doesnt hurt just to walk away because u wouldnt like it if u were in they situation and someone through something on u and all,u wouldnt.If u want to u can even take it in as ur own if the dog doesnt have a home.So u actually can make a difference in this world and there are many pets that need a home so if u want to please do this and if u dont want to no one is forcing u but if u do this shows ur love for pets.</p>
