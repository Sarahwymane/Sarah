      <p>I am Sarah Wymane and I am going to talk about how to make a difference to our lost pets.so the first thing i am going to go to is to talk about how to help our pets.We can help our lost pets.When there is a pet on the street we can help them by taking them as our own and by giving them treats n so on.We must not hurt the pets that we see on the street.we need to learn to care for our pets.</p>
